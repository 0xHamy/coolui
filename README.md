# Cool-ui

A place where I will be publishing some of the most creative, modern and sleek UI designs, animations and effects for websites.

Every directory contains a different design and all of them can very easily be incorporated in your own projects with minimal effort. They can be applied to any elements such as the following and many more:
- `<body>` background in HTML
- `<container>` backgrounds in bootstrap 5
- `<segment>` background in Semantic UI
- `<template>` background in vue

These are just some examples of where my animations have been tested but I usually created modular tools so you can use them anywhere. 

## A few demos

### Binary animation

This is the type of animation that you can apply on a round image, for example it could look great if applied to your Cyebersecurity company logo: <br>

### Laser animation for images

This animation was specifically created for images but it can be applied to any other elements. If you have got an image of the Matrix and want to add glitching effect on top of it, this is something you should consider using:

All of these animations are quite easy to implement & integrate with any existing website that you have. If you face any problems that can't be solved by your AI friends, please open an issue.
