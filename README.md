# Cool-ui

A place where I will be publishing some of the most creative, modern and sleek UI designs, animations and effects for websites.

Every directory contains a different design and all of them can very easily be incorporated in your own projects with minimal effort. They can be applied to any elements such as the following and many more:
- `<body>` background in HTML
- `<container>` backgrounds in bootstrap 5
- `<segment>` background in Semantic UI
- `<template>` background in vue

These are just some examples of where my animations have been tested but I usually created modular tools so you can use them anywhere. 


### Binary animation

This is the type of animation that you can apply on a round image, for example it could look great if applied to your Cyebersecurity company logo: <br>
![Binary animation demo](./binary-round-background/demo.png)

<br><br>


### Graph animation 

You can use this background in various ways, whether you want to create a futuristic animation for demonstrating a CTF or a calm dark background, you can use this graph:
![Graph background demo](./graph-background/demo.png)

<br><br>


### Hallucination animation
If you are looking for an animation that could keep people looking more than just a few seconds, this is something you should use:
